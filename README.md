# AIing
in this project i create my own Neural Network and teach it with genetic algorithms i developed inspired by the NEAT Algorythm to teach a Hexapod to walk in a simulation.
after teaching the network to walk I build a robot similar to the one in the simulation and use the network to make it walk.
